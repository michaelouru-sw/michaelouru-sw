**Introduction**
Hi, I'm Michael Ouru and I am a skilled web developer with expertise in the MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, and Node.js) stack. I am passionate about creating robust, scalable web applications that provide value to the end-user.

**Education and Training**
I completed the **MERN stack Complete Web Development** bootcamp, where I learned to develop and deploy full-stack JavaScript applications using the latest frameworks and tools. I gained hands-on experience building projects from scratch, developing backend APIs, and integrating machine learning algorithms into my applications.

**Skills**
- Full-stack development with MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js)
- Front-end skills: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Material-UI, Redux
- Backend skills: RESTful API design, authentication and authorization, database management with MongoDB and Mongoose, server-side rendering with Next.js
- Deployment and DevOps skills: AWS, Docker, Git, Heroku, Netlify
- Machine learning technologies: TensorFlow, Keras, Scikit-learn, Jupyter Notebook
- Strong problem-solving abilities, communication skills, and a fast learner with strong interpersonal skills

**Projects**
Here are some of the noteworthy projects I have developed during my time at the bootcamp:

Project 1: Keeper app, a note taking application which is a clone of the google keep.
Project 2: Newsletter signup, an app that allows you to post blog posts, and followers can sign up to the newsletters. This was implemented through mailchimp API integration, MongoDb, React.js, Express, and Node.js
